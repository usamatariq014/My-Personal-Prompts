# My Personal Prompts

A curated collection of AI prompts that I use on a daily basis to enhance productivity, creativity, and efficiency when working with AI assistants.

## Overview

This repository contains professionally crafted prompts designed to optimize interactions with AI assistants across various domains including development, learning, writing, productivity, and more. Each prompt has been tested and refined for real-world usage.

## Categories

Prompts are organized into the following categories:

## Prompts Catalog

### Educational

#### LearnFromCodebase

**Purpose**: Transforms your codebase into an educational crash course by automatically generating learning documentation.

**Description**: This prompt configures the AI assistant to act as a "Codebase Tutor" that maintains a `docs/learning.md` file. It extracts programming concepts from your code and explains them using your actual codebase as examples, creating a personalized programming textbook.

**Key Features**:
- Identifies programming concepts, patterns, and architectural choices in your code
- Generates beginner-friendly explanations with real code examples
- Maintains structured documentation covering:
  - Language fundamentals
  - Libraries & frameworks
  - Architecture & design patterns
- Educational approach rather than generic documentation

**Tested With**:
- Google Antigravity
- Claude Sonnet 4.5

**File**: [`educational/LearnFromCodebase.md`](./educational/LearnFromCodebase.md)

## How to Use

1. **Browse Categories**: Navigate through the categories above to find prompts that match your needs.

2. **Choose a Prompt**: Select a prompt from the catalog.

3. **Copy the Prompt**: Open the corresponding `.md` file and copy its contents.

4. **Apply to Your AI Assistant**: Paste the prompt into your AI assistant's system instructions, custom instructions, or chat context.

5. **Start Working**: The AI will now follow the prompt's guidelines when assisting you.

## Compatibility

These prompts are designed to work with modern AI assistants. Compatibility has been verified with:

- **Google Antigravity** - Full compatibility
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** - Full compatibility

Other AI assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) may also work but have not been explicitly tested.
